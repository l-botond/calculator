# Calculator
A simple calculator application built with widgets as part of a university project.

Features:

Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
Input: two numbers can be entered through the user interface.
User-friendly interface implemented with widgets (buttons, text fields).
Real-time display of results after an operation is selected.
Minimal and educational design focused on demonstrating widget usage.

Controls:

Enter the two numbers in the input fields.
Click the operation button (+, –, ×, ÷) to calculate.
The result appears in the display area.

Notes:

This project is intentionally simple and focuses on GUI handling.
Division by zero is not fully handled (optional extension).

Possible Improvements:

Add support for multiple chained operations.
Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
Extend with advanced functions (square root, power, memory storage).
Improve layout and styling of widgets.
